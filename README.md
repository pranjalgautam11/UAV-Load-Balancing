# 🚁 Multi-UAV Task Offloading Simulation

A simulation GUI for **task offloading and energy efficiency** using multiple UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in an IoT environment, designed for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

This simulation demonstrates:

- **IoT node deployment**
- **Trajectory optimization**
- **Intelligent task offloading**
- **Energy efficiency comparison** between:
  - Single UAV-based offloading
  - Proposed Multi-UAV offloading model

Developed using Python's `tkinter` for GUI and `matplotlib` for visualization.
